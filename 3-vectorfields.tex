We continue with our quest of generalizing multivariable calculus.
The next familiar object waiting to be questioned are vector fields.
In the euclidean settings these are simply continuous maps that attach a vector to each point in their domain.

The step to abstract manifold is rather intuitive in this case: a vector field will be a map that, at each point of a manifold, picks a tangent vector at that point in a smooth way.

\begin{defn}
    A $C^p$-map $X: M \to TM$ with $\pi\circ X = \id_M$, or equivalently $X_p\in T_pM$ for all $p\in M$, is called \emph{$C^p$-vector field}.
    We denote\footnote{The reason will become clear in a future chapter, but it boils down to the fact that tangent vector fields are just tensor fields of type $(1,0)$.} the set of smooth vector fields by $\cT_0^1(M)$.
\end{defn}
