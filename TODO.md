Changes which would complicate something for this year but should be performed for next year:

- move the block of text between Example 1.2.20 and Remark 1.2.23 to some place after Definition 1.3.7 since they involve diffeomorphisms.

- Add theorem showing the link between smooth functions, smooth maps between manifolds and charts.

- Move 2.8.21 at the end of 2.8

- Explain that vector bundles are useful to extend meaning of vector valued functions, where vector spaces are moving with the point, and mention it is important to understand geometry of injections and topology of spaces.

- Add pictures (video?) on how to draw a vector bundle on a cylinder and on a Moebius strip. Link it with the topology justification above.

- Add inverse theorem on submanifolds with boundary in the submanifolds section.

- Add divergence_\mu X = L_X \mu and use it to show divergence theorem

- Orientation, drop all intro and rewrite it using definition in terms of volume forms.

- Move 5.3.4 in before 5.3.2

- Add proof of fixed point thm using Stokes or a detailed exercise about it

- Mention Hodge star operator and maybe Laplace-Beltrami in appendix after volume forms

- Add exercise on Liouville theorem for hamiltonians in symplectic geometry

- Add exercise on fixed-points for gradient flows and Hamiltonian flows

- More computational exercises
