Changes which would complicate something for this year but should be performed for next year:

- move the block of text between Example 1.2.20 and Remark 1.2.23 to some place after Definition 1.3.7 since they involve diffeomorphisms.

- Add theorem showing the link between smooth functions, smooth maps between manifolds and charts.

- Move 2.8.21 at the end of 2.8

- Explain that vector bundles are useful to extend meaning of vector valued functions, where vector spaces are moving with the point, and mention it is important to understand geometry of injections and topology of spaces.

- Add pictures (video?) on how to draw a vector bundle on a cylinder and on a moebius strip. Link it with the topology justification above.
