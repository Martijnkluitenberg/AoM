# Lecture notes of the course Analysis On Manifolds

You can find the latest PDF in the [Releases](https://github.com/mseri/AoM/releases).

## Extra

Some freely accessible material, which could provide more pictures, different points of view and further developments of the material:

- [A pictorial introduction to differential geometry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08492.pdf) leads to Maxwell's equations with three pictures
- [Manifolds and differential forms](https://web.archive.org/web/20201121212724/http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~sjamaar/manifolds/manifold.pdf) has fantastic figures
- [Discrete Differential Geometry by Keenan Crane](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507020257/https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DGPDEC/paper.pdf) is a beautiful introduction to differential geometry and its use in three-dimensional geometry processing
- [Lectures on the geometry of manifolds by Liviu Nicolaescu](https://web.archive.org/web/20210507000841/https://www3.nd.edu/~lnicolae/Lectures.pdf) go way beyond this course up until a discussion of elliptic operators and Dirac operators
- [Lecture series by Frederic Schuller](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic) are high-quality lectures from the point of view of theoretical physics

Starting from 10.11.2021, the notes are released both using the TeX Gyre font and the Open Dyslexic font. Please consider supporting the [Open Dyslexic](https://github.com/antijingoist/open-dyslexic) font project.
