# Lecture notes of the course Analysis On Manifolds

Extra, freely accessible material, not used or linked in the lecture notes but which could provide more pictures and different points of view on the same material.

- [A pictorial introduction to differential geometry](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08492.pdf), leading to Maxwell's equations as three pictures
- [Manifolds and differential forms](https://web.archive.org/web/20201121212724/http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~sjamaar/manifolds/manifold.pdf), probably has the best pictures out there!
- [Lecture series by Frederic Schuller](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPH7f_7ZlzxTi6kS4vCmv4ZKm9u8g5yic), high-quality lectures from the point of view of theoretical physics
